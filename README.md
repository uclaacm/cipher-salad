# cipher salad

Cipher Salad is a learning lab designed to explore the history of sending secret messages, and why things get funky when you introduce computers.

Cipher Salad was made by the Teach LA Dev Team (Lisha, Janis, Rachel, and Alyssa) in collaboration with ACM Cyber. We wrote a blog post on how we made it, called [Ingredients of Cipher Salad](https://teachla.uclaacm.com/blog/dev/2020/10/13/ingredients-of-cipher-salad/)!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development Setup

We'll use a really common Node.js project workflow!

First, let's clone our repository, and install all of our node dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/uclaacm/cipher-salad.git
cd cipher-salad
npm install
```

To start our app, you just need to run `npm start`!

```
npm start
```

And to build our project for production (with CRA's webpack bundling and all that goodness),

```
npm run build
```
